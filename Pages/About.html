                <h4>HTML</h4>
                <p>HTML was the solid foundation for the structure and content found in each page. It provided the base
                    structure that is then modified via JavaScript. Example provided below.</p>

                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>JavaScript was used to dynamically generate the contents of some of the html pages (including this
                    one). It made the process of generating the contents for some of the pages easier and faster to do.
                    Example provided below.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Express JS / Node JS</h4>
                <p>Express JS is a JavaScript framework that I used for my webpage. We can think of Express as the
                    backbone of this application. It was the bridge that connected the individual elements of the
                    webpage and turned it into an actual web application. Example provided below.</p>
                <img src="./express_snippet.png">

            <section>
                <h4>AJAX</h4>
                <p>AJAX was used to fetch data from the server of the web application. By using AJAX the JavaScript is
                    able to retrieve the blogs stored on the server via the fetch call. This allows JavaScript to render
                    in a dynamic way the blogs that get added into the static HTML page. Example provided below.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>CSS</h4>
                <p>CSS is used to give style to some of the elements of my webpage. Some of this include the header that
                    is used in all the pages. Also, I used css to style the all of the Add Blog page. Example provided below.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
                <p>Bootstrap helped me handle most of the complex styling found in my webpage. The main example of this
                    are the cards used in the home page. By using bootstrap, I was able to style each post in the form
                    of a card and then render them using the grid features provided by bootstrap. Example provided below.</p>

            <h2>Discussions:</h2>
            <section>
                <h4>Discussion about Accessibility</h4>
                <p>Accessibility is something crucial that should be incorporated in more websites. Adding various
                    types of accessibility options to a website could be very beneficial to the website itself.
                    Accessibility options will facilitate the user experience for users that have disabilities. In
                    addition, it would raise the placement of the website in a web search result. Because it raises
                    the website in the list of results, it will indirectly increase the traffic of users through the
                    website, which could result in more revenue/profit. </p>

            <section>
                <h4>Discussion about Search Engine Optimization</h4>
                <p>Search Engine Optimization is the process of designing and optimizing a website in such a way that it
                    will appear higher on the list of results of a search engine. This is something convenient, because
                    the higher our page is in a search result list, the more likely that users will reach our website.
                    If our page is well optimized, it will get an increase of traffic, given that it will place high on
                    the list. This type of optimization is achieved in various ways: having meaningful and semantic
                    HTML, having integrated accessibility options, providing a good user experience/interface, providing
                    share-worthy information that can increase the number of external references, etc. By doing some of
                    these, we are guaranteed that our website will start placing higher. This is the main reason why
                    Search Engine Optimizations is very important.

                <h4>Discussion about CSS Preprocessing</h4>
                <p></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Discussion about JavaScript Transpiling</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is a language that has been around for many years, it is present in a great number of
                    websites, and it is a language that is continually growing and changing. Due to its rapid changes,
                    many websites that are not updated as often will soon start running outdated versions of JavaScript.
                    Because of this rapid growth and change of the language, it makes sense why transpiling code is
                    something necessary. Transpiling JavaScript is the process of taking current JavaScript code, and
                    translating it into an older version of JavaScript. This process gives us the capability to run and
                    use websites that are using legacy JS code.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Discussion about Static Web Generation</h4>
                <p>Static web generation happens when we take an HTML file and render it on the browser. Because HTML is
                    a text markup language, it is not dynamic. A static webpage has fixed content that will not change
                    regardless of what the user does. This is the main reason why static web generation is not that
                    great. In order to change a statically generated site, you will need to manually manipulate and edit
                    the original file. Modern websites don’t work like that. Today we have interactive websites that
                    will change their content based on things like user interaction. This makes static web pages look
                    obsolete. Nevertheless, today we still use static files to build the main structure of a page, and
                    then we will make that static file dynamic through the use of languages like JavaScript.
                    Incorporating JavaScript to a static file will allow the content of that static file to change
                    without having us to manually make those changes.</p>

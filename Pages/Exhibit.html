            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Simple web application that allows users to add blogs which are displayed (once posted) on the main page
                of the website. This project uses HTML to create the structure of each page, vanilla JavaScript to add
                add content to static HTML pages, Express JS running in Node JS to create a server that hosts the web
                application, CSS to handle styling, and Bootstrap to handle complex styling (i.e. the grid used in the
                main page).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>HTML will provide a form that queries for basic information about the post (title, description, and
                category). When the user hits submit, HTML will post the form via the POST method to one of the actions
                in the Express JS server. In this case, the /addblog action</p>
            <img src="./html_snippet.png">

            <p>Express JS will handle this from via a request. It will take the request and turn it into a blog object,
                which then gets added to a list of blogs inside the server.</p>
            <img src="./express_snippet_add.png">

            <p>After the user submits a post, he will be redirected back to the main page, and the blog will now be
                there. The list of blogs is retrieved from the Express JS server via a fetch call. This call will
                retrieve the list of blogs from the server, and then will add them to the main page.</p>
            <img src="./ajax_snippet.png">

            <p>Once the list of blogs is retrieved, JavaScript will determine how many rows the bootstrap container
                needs. Once this is done, JavaScript will add up to 3 blogs per row.
            </p>

            <img src="./ajax_snippet_print.png">

            <p>Once all this work is done, the main page will have the list of already existing blogs plus the newly
                added one by the user.

            <h4>What could improve?</h4>
            <p>
                I think that the main aspects of my project that need to improve are the styling of the project to make
                it more visually attractive, and the way how the Express JS server is built. There is still room for
                improvement in these two areas.

            <h4>Take-home lesson:</h4>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very powerful tool, and I encourage you to dedicate time to learn it. JavaScript is used
                very often in web applications, so knowing how to properly use it in both the front end and the back end
                of your application is something desirable. Currently many job opportunities ask for JavaScript
                knowledge, so it will be something worth your time to learn.
